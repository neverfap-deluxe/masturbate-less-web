My name is Julius Reade, and I've created this website to help people better understand themselves and their mental health issues. I write about the ways in which we make life unnecessarily difficult for ourselves, the context and functions behind these manifestations, and the techniques required to successfully break away from these mental cycles and embrace the beauty that life has to offer.

## We live in a world of...

<blockquote>Acute stress. Depression. Judgmental attitudes. Crippling insecurity. Social anxiety. Blinding cynicism. Feelings of unworthiness. Focused limitations. Low self-esteem. Fear. Internal rumination. Abusive relationships. Restlessness. Obsessive compulsive disorders. Intellectual dishonesty. Chasing fame. Negative thoughts. Hysteria. Self-reinforced delusion. Perceptions of failure. Ineffective coping mechanisms. Negative reactions. Unobtainable perfectionism. Logical fallacies. Deep-seated Pessimism. Drug abuse. Addiction. Absent gratitude. Guilt. Poor lifestyle. Manipulative behaviors. Unobtainable focus. Arrogance. Inner agitation. Never-ending grief. Emotional suffering. Broken agreements. Superiority complexes. Struggling with reality. Cognitive dissonance. Shame. Clinging to hope. Taking events personally. Self-criticism. Jadedness. Life without passion. Lost motivation. Self-hatred. Sleeplessness. Denial. Mental illness. Internal confusion. Irrational anger. Frustration. Incessant comparison.</blockquote>


...and we repeat these vicious cycles over and over again, like an irreversible curse. We are affected by these cycles every hour, from the moment we wake up until the moment we fall asleep. The sad thing is that a lot of people don't realise - all these things are **entirely preventable.**

This is the dangerous and confusing world of everyone's mind. I used to be every one of those things described above: I used to suffer from depression; I used to be very confused and hurt about life, yet to me, it was all just an everyday occurrence. You don't question what feels inherently "normal".

Thankfully, I have two very contradictory benefits as a person that helped me break these cycles and understand how these damaging behaviors work. Firstly, I never give up no matter how badly I'm beaten and secondly, I always learn the hard way. I trial and error every single experience, good and bad, before I find the strength to finally move on from the pain. While this may seem like a recipe for disaster, it also allows for personal leverage to grasp, toy and manipulate with the way these delusions manifest.

It also means that I no longer suffer helplessly from these symptoms. It doesn't mean that I'm immune to letting these cycles recur, however this is one of the beauties of self-awareness. It allows you to consistently understand the way you function and how best to enhance your life.

## What is self-awareness?


It's helpful to visualise self-awareness as a mental framework to understanding who you are and how your personality and biology conflict to create your entire mental state. Self-awareness is not like a Band-Aid for a quick-fix, and it cannot instantly and permanently prevent you from feeling depressed or confused about life. Self-awareness can, however, provide you with a powerful methodological and cognitive process to help you change for the better and give you tools to cope with the worst. It is a secure stepping stone towards addressing the cognitive dissonances in our thoughts, feelings, behaviours and emotions.

**More succinctly, self-awareness is a framework for _description_.** You may not quite know it yet, but words and language are fundamental to the way we process information, especially regarding how we feel and think. The great thing about self-awareness is that it's completely personal, and equally effective of understanding and communicating thought. Self-awareness is something that grows over time. There's always more and more to learn about yourself and the way nature functions and effects you. The longer you take the time to study self-awareness, the more you'll discover about the essence of humanity- the way we think and feel, as well as every other factor that happens to encompass reality.


<blockquote>Choices lead to behaviors.

Behaviors lead to habits.

Habits lead to character.</blockquote>


Ultimately, we’re all shaped by what we believe in. Our beliefs help us form the basis of the images and understanding of people and normalcy, as well the thoughts and behaviors we rely on to function. **Once we become aware of our beliefs and identities, we can learn how to change who we are almost effortlessly. **

Understanding our beliefs can help us discover how our crippling insecurities are formed; our issues with low self-esteem; the ways in which we lose our passion for life - we seemingly focus on our limitations, live in a world of self-criticism and judgment, take every minute detail personally, as well as every other victimisation with force upon ourselves on a daily basis. By learning to become self-aware, we can finally take our mental health seriously with an approach that neither gives nor takes.


<blockquote>With the correct technique anyone can learn, or unlearn, anything.</blockquote>


Many of us think our emotions are ultimately irrational, however it’s actually our harmful beliefs and the false images that affect the way we think, behave, and feel. Our negative emotions are a consequence of a broken system of belief. Even if we have good intentions for ourselves, which most of us do, without a proper technique and framework we cannot truly hope to change who we are. One pianist can spend 40 years learning a difficult piece and still not be able to play it properly, yet a similarly skilled pianist can learn the same piece within a few weeks. Technique and framework are the basis of talent; talent itself never stands on it's own.

## Personal responsibility for our mental health


You see, most are actually quite impartial to having negative thoughts on any number of disorders that plague our society. I don't take the view that these behaviors are inherently bad things - I merely see them as a by-product of the way we think and behave. Humans are misguided; sometimes intentionally, other times unintentionally. Self-awareness isn't a system of morals, of good and bad. **Self-awareness is about understanding the acceptance and responsibility that we owe to ourselves, if we're ever to change the way we feel, think and behave.**

We don't suffer needlessly because we're bad people. We never mean harm. I personally didn't even know I was depressed and dysfunction until much later in life. I thought all these behaviors were normal and that anyone not suffering was plain and simple. In a sense, I thought everyone was sad without acknowledging it. It wasn't until I'd reached my breaking point, that I'd decided to discover a new way of thinking. Through self-awareness, I was able to observe these behaviors for what they truly were and give myself a chance to breathe. It gave me the power and responsibility to change myself, however I liked.


<blockquote>There's an epiphany most people go through when they start thinking about the way their problems work. They read an article on jealousy or judgmental attitudes and their mind flashes. "Oh my gosh, that's exactly how it works and I'm exactly that person!"</blockquote>


Naturally, changing after a lifetime of reinforced and destructive habits isn't a simple process. I certainly didn't change overnight, and there was a lot of resistance to freeing the tension in my mind. Yet we all get there in the end if we give ourselves a chance. I know I did, even though many won't. This is why I wanted to make a make a website to give people a better chance at becoming self-aware; to learn with ease and passion.

## Mental health for a 21st century


My articles are designed to help you understand, not only how we form these behaviors, but the resistance involved and how best to approach them. Through my articles, you will learn about how these thought patterns arise and the ways in which they exaggerate over time to become abusive, unholy shires in our minds. It will be an epiphany for many of you - an answer to the functioning of your suffering.

There's one saying that I particularly like, which I think echos what mental health is about. **Put simply, being ignorant of our actions and reality, does not lessen the consequences of these actions.** Repeating offensive behaviors with good intentions, is still going to produce an offensive outcome.


<blockquote>Self-awareness is an important life skill because it has the potential to prevent continued emotional suffering and pain for as long as you choose.</blockquote>


Imagine all the time spent being frustrated and angry- all those days lost and irritated. All those days mired in sadness and loneliness. This website aims to cover everything you need to help and understand yourself. It takes a special kind of courage to attempt the seemingly impossible, but without our dreams, we are nothing but empty shells, with hope only as a mere afterthought.

I’ve written more than 300 articles detailing the issues and dilemmas that people suffer from daily. The logic behind these dilemmas certainly aren't complex; it's only once they form into habit do they slide into our consciousness and blend into the exterior of our hearts. Once we become consciously aware of what we're truly doing to ourselves, not only acknowledging our problems, but understanding the way they function, then and only then will change come naturally thereafter.

Of course, it's a lot easier said that done. Nothing worth doing in life is easy, but that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable. Ask yourself, is your mental health your number one priority? What are the long term consequences of not focusing on your mental health? Only you have the power to decide.

## Making a commitment to your happiness today


I remember making a commitment to myself, a few months prior to my birthday. I was in complete shambles. My break up had completely decimated my will to live, I'd nearly overdosed on a research chemical which had lead to hospitalisation, and my life was reduced to crying in bed for as long as the tears would flow. It was a very difficult time, but it was also a turning point for me in my life. I'd decided to make a commitment to myself, a commitment I would never walk away from:


<blockquote>**I was going to do absolutely everything in my power to be a happy individual, no matter what.**</blockquote>


I made this commitment, and I've never looked back. It may very well be the smartest decision of your entire life. While finding the courage to approach your life with intent may seem difficult, is any more difficult than spending the rest of your life living in perpetual pain? As for me, it was a complicated journey, but here I stand today - a proud subject and happy to be alive and thankful for every second of it. And you can feel the same.
