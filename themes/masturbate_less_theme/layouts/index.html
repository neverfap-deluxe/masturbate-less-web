              <p>It's a natural human function, no different to eating or worrying about your finances.</p>

                <h2>The primary reason why we <u>masturbate</u> is to cope with reality. <i class="em em-sweat_smile"></i></h2>
                <p>No different to exercising, chain smoking, meditating, excessively comfort eating, gulping a healthy smoothie, getting blind drunk or actively learning and self-improving.</p>
                <p>These are all different ways we can cope with reality, and masturbation is simply one of many different ways we can cope.</p>
                <h3>Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with the act of masturbation itself.</h3>
                <p>Just as there's nothing inherently wrong with shooting up heroin or taking a relaxing bath.</p>
                <p>It's merely a coping mechanism, and therefore a choice that you can consciously engage with.</p>
                <p>Sure, there are very real consequences in the ways that we decide to cope, however that doesn't change the fact that coping mechanisms boil down to actions that we make at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>Which is important to understand.</p>
                <h3>Because it also validates <u>not masturbating</u> as a way to cope as well.</h3>
                <p>Which is true.</p>
                <p>You see, here's the thing with <b>Masturbate Less</b>. We don't prescribe to moral arguments, and we're a judgement-free zone.</p>
                <p>We believe in freedom of choice, whether that be masturbating daily or not masturbating at all.</p>
                <p>All we're doing is explaining the dynamics of what you as a human being can do, so you don't get caught up in the traps of guilt, shame and self-criticism that hinder the process of change.</p>
                <p>In other words, regardless of how you live your life your mental health always comes first.</p>

              <h2>Now, there are two broad categories of coping mechanisms.</h2>
              <p>There are effective coping mechanisms and there and ineffective coping mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Sure, some are also significantly healthier or unhealthier than others, however that's also a highly subjective thing and also largely dependenant upon how you use them in your life.</p>
              <p>For example, I would describe masturbation as an unhealthy coping mechanism, although others may describe it as a healthy coping mechanism.</p>
              <p>It purely comes down to personal preference, as well as your own individual experience.</p>
              <h3>Now, you can only stop <u>masturbating</u> if you can first identify it as a problem.</h3>
              <p>Which is to say that if you don't have a problem with the amount you masturbate, or with how your masturbation impacts your life, then there's literally no reason to stop.</p>
              <p>No reason. No change.</p>
              <p>And certainly, regardless of what the internet says or what your own self-esteem reveals about you, no one is pressuring you to stop masturbating. That's not how change works.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you feel as if masturbation is a problem in your life, then you'll have reason to change.</p>
              <h3>How you can you identify whether masturbation is a problem in your life?</h3>
              <p>Well, ultimately it comes down to asking one very simple question. Do you feel as if you're coping effectively with life?</p>
              <p>If not, then clearly it indicates that your coping mechanisms simply aren't working out for you. If yes, then there's literally nothing to worry about.</p>
              <p>With that said, if you're having doubts about whether you're coping effectively or not, then chances are that you're not coping effectively, as doubt and fear itself is not effective coping.</p>
              <p>Does this necessarily mean that masturbation itself is the problem? Of course not, but in general it can help to replace all our existing habits with healthier alternatives in order to address this problem.</p>
              <p>Which in most cases, means reducing the amount we masturbate overall, if not outright eliminating it.</p>
              <p>Because chances are, if you're not coping effectively then you're most likely masturbating for all the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>And certainly that was my own personal experience.</p>

              <p>And the reason why it's a problem for a lot of people is because masturbation is a really ineffective way of dealing with those problems.</p>
